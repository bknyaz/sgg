In this visualization, `woman sitting on rock` is a **zero-shot** triplet, which means that the combination of `woman`, `sitting on` and `rock` has never been observed during training. However, each of the object and predicate has been observed, but together with other objects and predicate. For example, `woman sitting on chair` has been observed and is not a zero-shot triplet. Making correct predictions for zero-shots is very challenging, so in our papers [1,2] we address this problem and improve zero-shot as well as few-shot results. See examples of zero-shots in the Visual Genome (VG) dataset at [Zero_Shot_VG.ipynb](Zero_Shot_VG.ipynb).


This repository accompanies two papers: 

- [1] [Boris Knyazev, Harm de Vries, Cătălina Cangea, Graham W. Taylor, Aaron Courville, Eugene Belilovsky. "Graph Density-Aware Losses for Novel Compositions in Scene Graph Generation", **BMVC 2020**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08230)

- [2] [Boris Knyazev, Harm de Vries, Cătălina Cangea, Graham W. Taylor, Aaron Courville, Eugene Belilovsky. "Generative Compositional Augmentations for Scene Graph Prediction", **ICCV 2021**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05756)


See the code for my another ICCV 2021 paper [Context-aware Scene Graph Generation with Seq2Seq Transformers](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~mvolkovs/ICCV2021_Transformer_SGG.pdf) at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/SGG-Seq2Seq.

The code in this repo is based on the amazing [code for Neural Motifs by Rowan Zellers](https://github.com/rowanz/neural-motifs). Our code uses `torchvision.models.detection`, so can be run in PyTorch 1.2 or later.

# Weights and Biases

Weights and Biases is a cool tool to track your machine learning experiments that I used in this project.
It is free (in most cases) and very user-friendly, which is very helpful for complex projects with lots of metrics (like SGG).

See our [Weights and Biases (W & B) project](https://wandb.ai/bknyaz/iccv2021gan) for the results on different SGG metrics and training curves.

# Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- PyTorch >= 1.2
- Other standard Python libraries

Should be enough to install these libraries (in addition to PyTorch):
```
conda install -c anaconda h5py cython dill pandas
conda install -c conda-forge pycocotools tqdm
```

Results in our papers [1,2] were obtained on a single GPU 1080Ti/2080Ti/RTX6000 with 11-24GB of GPU memory and 32GB of RAM. MultiGPU training is unfortunately not supported in this repo.

To use the edge feature model from Rowan Zellers' model implementations (default argument `-edge_model motifs` in our code), it is necessary to build the following function:

`cd lib/draw_rectangles; python setup.py build_ext --inplace; cd ../..;`


# Data

Visual Genome or GQA data will be automatically downloaded after the first call of `python main.py -data $data_path`. After downloading, the script will generate the following directories (make sure you have at least 60GB of disk space in `$data_path`):

```
data_path
│   VG
│   │   VG.tar
│   │   VG_100K (this will appear after extracting VG.tar)
│   │   ...
│
└───GQA # optional
│   │   GQA_scenegraphs.tar
│   │   sceneGraphs (this will appear after extracting GQA_scenegraphs.tar)
|   |   ...
```

If downloading fails, you can download manually using the links from [lib/download.py](lib/download.py). Alternatively, the VG can be downloaded following [Rowan Zellers' instructions](https://github.com/rowanz/neural-motifs), while GQA can be downloaded from the [GQA official website](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/dorarad/gqa/about.html).
 
To train SGG models on VG, download [Rowan Zellers' VGG16 detector checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11zKRr2OF5oclFL47kjFYBOxScotQzArX) and save it as `./data/VG/vg-faster-rcnn.tar`.

To train our GAN models from [2], it is necessary to first extract and save real object features from the training set of VG by running:

`python extract_features.py -data ./data/ -ckpt ./data/VG/vg-faster-rcnn.tar -save_dir ./data/VG/`

The script will generate `./data/VG/features.hdf5` of around 30GB.

# Example from [1]: Improved edge loss

Our improved edge loss from [1] can be added to any SGG model that predicts edge labels `rel_dists`, which is a float valued tensor of shape `(M,R)`, where `R` is the total number of predicate classes (e.g. 51 in Visual Genome). `M` is the total number of edges in a batch of scene graphs, including the background edges (edges without any semantic relationships).

The baseline loss used in most SGG works simply computes the cross-entropy between `rel_dists` and ground truth edge labels `rel_labels` (an integer tensor of length `M`):

```
baseline_edge_loss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(rel_dists, rel_labels)
```

Our improved edge loss takes into account the extreme imbalance between the foreground and background edge terms. Foreground edges are those that have semantic ground truth annotations (e.g. `on`, `has`, `wearing`, etc.). In datasets like Visual Genome, scene graph annotations are extremely sparse, i.e. the number of foreground edges (`M_FG`) is significantly lower than the total number of edges `M`.

```    
baseline_edge_loss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(rel_dists, rel_labels)
M = len(rel_labels)
M_FG = torch.sum(rel_labels > 0)
our_edge_loss = baseline_edge_loss * M / M_FG
```

Our improved loss significantly improves all SGG metrics, in particular zero and few shots. See [1] for the results and discussion why our loss works well. 

See the full code of different losses in [lib/losses.py](lib/losses.py).

# Example from [2]: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

In this example I provide the pseudo code for adding the GAN model to a given SGG model. See the full code in [main.py](main.py).

```
from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy as CE

# Assume the SGG model (sgg_model) returns features for 
# nodes (nodes_real) and edges (edges_real) as well as global features (fmap_real).

# 1. Main SGG model object and relationship classification losses (L_CLS)

obj_dists, rel_dists = sgg_model.predict(nodes_real, edges_real)  # predict node and edge labels
node_loss = CE(obj_dists, gt_objects)
M = len(rel_labels)
M_FG = torch.sum(rel_labels > 0)
our_edge_loss = CE(rel_dists, rel_labels) *  M / M_FG  # use our improved edge loss from [1]

L_CLS = node_loss + our_edge_loss  # SGG total loss from [1]
L_CLS.backward()
F_optimizer.step()  # update the sgg_model (main SGG model F)

# 2. GAN-based updates

# Scene Graph perturbations (optional)
gt_objects_fake = sgp.perturb(gt_objects, gt_rels)  # we only perturb nodes (object labels)

# Generate global feature maps using our GAN conditioned on (perturbed) scene graphs
fmap_fake = gan(gt_objects_fake, gt_boxes, gt_rels)

# Extract node and edge features from fmap_fake
nodes_fake, edges_fake = sgg_model.node_edge_features(fmap_fake)

# Make SGG predictions for the node and edge features 
# Detach the gradients to avoid bad collaboration of G and F
obj_dists_fake, rel_dists_fake = sgg_model.predict(nodes_fake.detach(),
                                                   edges_fake.detach())

# 2.1. Generator (G) losses

# Adversarial losses
L_ADV_G_nodes = gan.loss(nodes_fake, labels_fake=gt_objects_fake)
L_ADV_G_edges = gan.loss(edges_fake, labels_fake=rel_labels)
L_ADV_G_global = gan.loss(fmap_fake)

# Reconstruction losses
L_REC_nodes = CE(obj_dists_fake, gt_objects_fake)
L_REC_edges = CE(rel_dists_fake, rel_labels) *  M / M_FG  # use our improved edge loss from [1]

# Total G loss
loss_G_F = L_ADV_G_nodes + L_ADV_G_edges + L_ADV_G_global + L_REC_nodes + L_REC_edges
loss_G_F.backward()
F_optimizer.step()  # update the sgg_model (main SGG model F)
G_optimizer.step()  # update the generator (G) of the GAN

# 2.1. Discriminator (D) losses

# Adversarial losses
L_ADV_D_nodes = gan.loss(node_real, nodes_fake, labels_fake=gt_objects_fake, labels_real=gt_objects)
L_ADV_D_edges = gan.loss(edge_real, edges_fake, labels_fake=rel_labels, labels_real=rel_labels)
L_ADV_D_global = gan.loss(fmap_real, fmap_fake)

# Total D loss
loss_D = L_ADV_D_nodes + L_ADV_D_edges + L_ADV_D_global
loss_D.backward()  # update the discriminator (D) of the GAN
D_optimizer.step()

```

Adding our GAN also consistently improves all SGG metrics. See [2] for the results, model description and analysis.

Evaluation on the VG test set will be run at the end of the training script. To re-run evaluation: `python main.py -data ./data -ckpt ./results/IMP_GAN_graphn/vgrel.pth -pred_weight $x`, where `$x` is the weight for rare predicate classes, which is 1 for default, but can be increased to improve certain metrics like mean recall (see the Appendix in our paper [2] for more details).

## Generated Feature Quality

To inspect the features generated with GANs, it is necessary to first extract and save node/edge/global features. This can be done similarly to the code in `extract_features.py`, but replacing the real features with the ones produced by the GAN.

See [this jupyter notebook to inspect generated feature quality](GAN_features.ipynb).

## Scene Graph Perturbations

See [this jupyter notebook to inspect scene graph perturbation methods](Scene_Graph_Perturbations_VG.ipynb).


## SGGen (optional)

Please follow the details in our papers to obtain SGGen/SGDet results, which are based on using the original Neural Motifs code.

Pull-requests to add training and evaluation SGGen/SGDet models with the VGG16 or another backbone are welcome.


# GQA

**Note: these instructions are for our BMVC 2020 paper [1] and have not been tested in the last version of the repo**

## SGCls/PredCls
 
To train an SGCls/PredCls model with our loss on GQA: `python main.py -data ./data -loss dnorm -split gqa -lr 0.002 -save_dir ./results/GQA_sgcls`  # takes about 1 day. Or download our [GQA-SGCls-1 checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ktyV7atNRIS0UhiQOoPCR_392FQz6eB6/view?usp=sharing)

In the trained checkpoints of this repo I used a slightly different edge model in [UnionBoxesAndFeats](lib/get_union_boxes.py) `-edge_model raw_boxes`. To use [Neural Motifs's](https://github.com/rowanz/neural-motifs) edge model, use flag `-edge_model motifs` (default in the current version of the repo).

## SGGen (optional)

Follow these steps to train and evaluate an SGGen model on GQA:

 1. Fine-tune Mask R-CNN on GQA:
`python pretrain_detector.py gqa ./data ./results/pretrain_GQA`  # takes about 1 day. Or download our [GQA-detector checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VR8uMR0WMbqiA2hPIxq7AzvpNqzzyKfT/view?usp=sharing)

2. Train SGCls:
`python main.py -data ./data -lr 0.002 -split gqa -nosave -loss dnorm -ckpt ./results/pretrain_GQA/gqa_maskrcnn_res50fpn.pth -save_dir ./results/GQA_sgdet`   # takes about 1 day. Or download our [GQA-SGCls-2 checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wldE-ONCs15balmR1IdZvnD2byZ8dNB7/view?usp=sharing). This checkpoint is different from SGCls-1, because here the model is trained on the features of the GQA-pretrained detector.
This checkpoint can be used in the next step.

3. Evaluate SGGen:
`python main.py -data ./data -split gqa -ckpt ./results/GQA_sgdet/vgrel.pth -m sgdet -nosave -nepoch 0`  # takes a couple hours
